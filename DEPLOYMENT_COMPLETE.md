### Production URL: http://34.235.117.235

## 🔧 Deployment Capabilities

### Robust Deployment Process:
```bash
# Full production deployment
./deploy-enhanced.sh all

# Component-specific deployment
./deploy-enhanced.sh backend
./deploy-enhanced.sh frontend

# Skip tests (emergency only)
./deploy-enhanced.sh all --skip-tests
```

### Automatic Infrastructure Management:
- ✅ Disk space monitoring and EBS auto-resizing
- ✅ System dependency installation and updates
- ✅ Service configuration (nginx, PM2, MongoDB)
- ✅ Security header and CORS configuration
- ✅ Demo user creation and admin privilege setup

## 📈 Health Monitoring Features

### Real-Time Monitoring:
```bash
# Quick health check (30 seconds)
./health-check-quick.sh

# Comprehensive analysis with scoring
./health-monitor-comprehensive.sh

# Continuous monitoring with alerts
./health-monitor-comprehensive.sh --continuous --alert
```

### Health Scoring System:
- **Frontend**: 30 points (accessibility, content, React structure)
- **Backend**: 40 points (API health, authentication, PM2 status)
- **Database**: 20 points (MongoDB service, connectivity, demo users)
- **Infrastructure**: 10 points (nginx status, system resources)

### Status Levels:
- **🎉 HEALTHY (80-100%)**: All systems operational
- **⚠️ WARNING (60-79%)**: Some issues detected
- **🚨 CRITICAL (0-59%)**: Immediate attention needed

## 🛡️ Security & Reliability

### Enhanced Security:
- ✅ nginx security headers (XSS, CSRF, Content-Type protection)
- ✅ JWT-based authentication with proper validation
- ✅ Admin users with unlimited system privileges
- ✅ Rate limiting and CORS configuration

### Reliability Features:
- ✅ PM2 process management with auto-restart
- ✅ MongoDB local installation for reduced dependencies
- ✅ Frontend defensive coding prevents runtime errors
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and logging
