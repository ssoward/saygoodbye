### Production Troubleshooting Guide

#### Image Validation Issues
If users report "No validation results available" for image uploads:

1. **Check image processing service integration**:
   ```bash
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/saygoodbye.pem ec2-user@34.235.117.235
   cd /home/ec2-user/saygoodbye/backend
   grep -n "extractTextFromImage" src/services/documentValidation.js
   ```

2. **Verify the method call is correct**:
   Should be `this.imageProcessor.extractTextFromImage(imageBuffer)` 
   NOT `this.imageProcessor.performOCR(filePath)`

3. **Test image processing manually**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/documents \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     -F "document=@test-image.png"
   ```

4. **Check PM2 logs for OCR errors**:
   ```bash
   pm2 logs saygoodbye-api | grep -i "image\|ocr\|tesseract"
   ```

5. **Restart service if needed**:
   ```bash
   pm2 restart saygoodbye-api
   ```

#### Site Down (500 Errors)
If the site is completely down:

1. **Check all services**:
   ```bash
   # Check MongoDB
   sudo systemctl status mongod
   
   # Check PM2 application  
   pm2 status
   
   # Check nginx
   sudo systemctl status nginx
   ```

2. **Restart services in order**:
   ```bash
   # Restart MongoDB if needed
   sudo systemctl restart mongod
   
   # Restart PM2 application
   pm2 restart saygoodbye-api
   
   # Restart nginx 
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

3. **Check health endpoints**:
   ```bash
   # Check backend directly
   curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
   
   # Check through nginx proxy
   curl http://localhost/api/health
   ```

4. **Emergency nginx rebuild**:
   ```bash
   # If nginx config is corrupted, rebuild from minimal config
   sudo cp /etc/nginx/nginx.conf.backup /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

#### Health Monitoring
Monitor system health continuously:

```bash
# Check automated health log
tail -f /home/ec2-user/health.log

# Run manual health check
/home/ec2-user/saygoodbye/health-check.sh

# Monitor system resources
htop
df -h
free -m
```

### Emergency Rollback Procedures

If deployment fails or causes issues:

1. **Rollback to previous deployment**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/ec2-user/backups
   LATEST_BACKUP=$(ls -1t backup_*.tar.gz | head -1)
   cd /home/ec2-user
   sudo rm -rf saygoodbye_failed
   mv saygoodbye saygoodbye_failed
   tar -xzf backups/$LATEST_BACKUP
   pm2 restart saygoodbye-api
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

2. **Verify rollback success**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost/api/health
   ```

### Deployment Best Practices

1. **Always test deployment script changes locally first**
2. **Create backup before any major changes**
3. **Monitor health log during and after deployment**
4. **Verify all endpoints work after deployment**
5. **Keep SSH access ready for emergency interventions**

## 🏥 Health Monitoring

### Comprehensive Monitoring System

The health monitoring system provides two main levels of monitoring:

#### 1. Quick Health Check
```bash
./health-check-quick.sh
```
- 30-second system validation
- Basic service availability check
- Simple pass/fail reporting with health percentage

#### 2. Comprehensive Health Monitor
```bash
./health-monitor-comprehensive.sh
```
- Complete system analysis with detailed scoring
- JSON report generation with historical data
- User flow validation and performance benchmarking
- Automated alerting capabilities

#### 3. Continuous Monitoring
```bash
# Start continuous monitoring with alerts
./health-monitor-comprehensive.sh --continuous --alert --email your-email@domain.com

# Custom monitoring interval (default: 5 minutes)
./health-monitor-comprehensive.sh --continuous --interval 300
```

### Health Scoring System

The comprehensive monitoring system uses a 100-point scoring system:

| Component | Max Score | Weight | Checks |
|-----------|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Frontend** | 30 points | 30% | HTTP response, content validation, React structure |
| **Backend** | 40 points | 40% | API health, authentication, PM2 status |
| **Database** | 20 points | 20% | MongoDB service, connectivity, demo users |
| **Infrastructure** | 10 points | 10% | nginx status, system resources |

#### Health Status Levels
- **🎉 HEALTHY (80-100%)**: All systems operational
- **⚠️ WARNING (60-79%)**: Some issues detected, monitoring required
- **🚨 CRITICAL (0-59%)**: Immediate attention needed

### Automated Monitoring Setup

```bash
# Setup comprehensive monitoring with automated alerts
./setup-monitoring-advanced.sh

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Image Validation Issues

If you see "No validation results available" when uploading images:

1. **Check file format**: Ensure you're uploading supported image formats:
   - JPG/JPEG
   - PNG
   - GIF
   - BMP
   - TIFF
   - WebP

2. **Check file size**: Files must be under 10MB

3. **Image quality**: For best OCR results:
   - Use high contrast images
   - Ensure text is clear and readable
   - Scan at 300 DPI or higher
   - Avoid blurry or skewed images

4. **Processing time**: Image validation takes longer than PDF validation due to OCR processing. Wait 30-60 seconds for results.

5. **Check server logs**: 
   ```bash
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/saygoodbye.pem ec2-user@34.235.117.235
   pm2 logs saygoodbye-api
   ```

6. **Test image processing services**:
   - Visit: http://34.235.117.235/api/documents/test-image-processing
   - This endpoint shows if image processing services are loaded correctly

### Common Issues

**"No validation results available"**
- The document is still processing (check back in 1-2 minutes)
- OCR failed to extract text from the image
- Image quality is too poor for text extraction

**Upload fails**
- File format not supported
- File size too large (>10MB)
- Network connectivity issues

**Slow processing**
- Large image files take longer to process
- OCR is computationally intensive
- Server may be under load
