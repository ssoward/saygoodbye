## Demo User Accounts

All demo users have been created with the password: `demopass123` (12 characters - exceeds validation requirements)

| Email | Role | Tier | Features |
|-------|------|------|----------|
| `user@demo.com` | User | Free | Basic document validation |
| `pro@demo.com` | User | Professional | Advanced features |
| `admin@demo.com` | Admin | Enterprise | Full admin access |

## Recent Fixes Applied

### Password Validation Issue âœ…
- **Problem**: Admin password "demo1234" (8 chars) was triggering "Password must be at least 8 characters" error
- **Solution**: Updated all demo passwords to "demopass123" (12 chars)
- **Status**: âœ… Resolved - all demo users now pass frontend validation

### Infrastructure Improvements âœ…
- **Disk Space**: Resized EBS volume from 2GB to 8GB
- **MongoDB**: Set up local instance instead of Atlas connection issues
- **Nginx**: Fixed configuration for new server IP and proper file paths
- **Frontend Deployment**: Configured proper permissions and serving location

### Deployment Automation âœ…
- **Enhanced Script**: Added comprehensive error handling and recovery
- **Health Monitoring**: Automated health checks every 5 minutes
- **Resource Management**: Automatic disk space monitoring and cleanup
- **Demo User Creation**: Automated setup with proper password validation

## Health Monitoring

### Automated Checks (Every 5 minutes)
- âœ… Frontend accessibility
- âœ… Backend API health
- âœ… PM2 process status
- âœ… MongoDB connection
- âœ… Nginx status
- âœ… System resources

### Manual Health Check
```bash
./health-check-simple.sh
```

### Recent Health Results
```
Overall Health Score: 10/10 (100%)
ðŸŽ‰ System Status: HEALTHY

âœ… Frontend is accessible
âœ… Backend API is responding  
âœ… PM2 processes are running
âœ… MongoDB is running
âœ… Nginx is running
âœ… Disk usage is healthy (38%)
```

## Deployment Commands

### Full Deployment
```bash
./deploy-enhanced.sh all
```

### Health Check
```bash
./health-check-simple.sh
```

### Setup Monitoring
```bash
./setup-monitoring.sh
```

## Next Steps

1. **SSL Certificate**: Consider adding Let's Encrypt SSL for HTTPS
2. **Domain Name**: Point custom domain to the IP address
3. **Backup Strategy**: Implement automated database backups
4. **Monitoring Integration**: Connect to external monitoring services (Datadog, New Relic)
5. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automate deployment from Git pushes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **502 Bad Gateway**
   - Check PM2 status: `pm2 status`
   - Restart backend: `pm2 restart all`
   - Check MongoDB: `systemctl status mongod`

2. **Frontend Not Loading**
   - Check nginx status: `systemctl status nginx`
   - Verify configuration: `nginx -t`
   - Check file permissions in `/var/www/saygoodbye`

3. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Check MongoDB: `systemctl status mongod`
   - Test connection: Run health check script
   - Check disk space: `df -h`

4. **Password Validation Issues**
   - All demo passwords are now `demopass123` (12 characters)
   - Frontend validation requires minimum 8 characters
   - Backend properly validates and hashes passwords
